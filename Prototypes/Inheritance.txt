Circle Class 
with one method computeOptimumLocation()

Square Class
with one method computeOptimumLocation()

this is bad as if there is a bug in computeOptimumLocation since 
its defined twice there is gonna be an issue in both classes and 
you have to go int oboth and fix them individually.



Instead a better solution is through using inheritance

create a shape class (aka base/super/parent)
and have the circle and square inherit from it


Two types of classes Classical and Prototypical
classical is because of classes (doesnt really apply to JS)
Prototypical applies more to JS
